# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of Project
Louise has asked us to analyze various fundraisings to understand better the factors involved in launching a campaign for herself.
### Purpose
After going over multiple factors related to launching the campaign, now she has decided to emphasize finding the relationship between the aftermath of these campaigns based on the month that they were established and the amount of money they were supposed to attain.
## Analysis and Challenges
Since there are two different projects, we basically breakdown the analyses into two sections.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In the new KickStarter_Challenge worksheet we have created a new column named Years. The values of the column are extracted from the date created conversion column by using [Year](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/year-function-c64f017a-1354-490d-981f-578e8ec8d3b9) ![Year](year.png)
